    <h2>Pollution, What is it?</h2>
    <p>Pollution is the releasing of substances into the environment in amounts that can cause harmful effects and which
      natural biological processes cannot easily remove. It is the contamination of an environment by a sustance - known
      as a pollutant - that reduces its quality in some way, shape or form. </p>

    <h2> What are pollutants and why are they bad?</h2>
    <p> Pollutants are substances introduced into an environment which have undesired effects and/or adversely impacts
      the usefulnes of a resource. These pollutants damage the environment in some aspect with the potential to harm the
      human, animal or plant life present. Pollutants can be foreign man made substances - and usually they are - or in
      some cases naturally produced substances with potential to cause harm. </p>
    <h2> Types of Pollutants</h2>
    <p>While there are many possible ways to classify pollutants, most pollutants fall into two major categories:
    <ul>
      <li>Biodegradable Pollutants</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Pollutants which can be broken down into simpler, harmless substances naturally in due time by decomposers
          and micro-organisms like bacteria and fungi.</li>
      </ul> <br>
      <li> Non-Biodegradable Pollutants</li>
      <ul>
        <li> This is the opposite of a biodegradable pollutat, these are pollutants which cannot be broken down and
          decomposed naturally or pollutants which take very long to be decomposed naturally.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Pollution</h2>
    <p>There are many types of pollution but there are roughly seven main types which have the largest impact. These
      types are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Land Pollution</li>
      <li>Water Pollution</li>
      <li>Air Pollution</li>
      <li> Light Pollution</li>
      <li> Noise Pollution</li>
      <li>Thermal Pollution</li>
      <li>Radioacive Pollution</li>

    </ol>
    Each Type of pollution mentioned has its own specific causes and effects with individualized solutions but something
    each has in common with the others is that they all cause harm to the environment and its inhabitents. Pollution has
    been a problem for a long time but with the advent of the Industrial Revolution it has increased exponentially. Due
    to the excessive amounts of pollution several of Earth's resources have become contaminated. If this continues soon
    the earth will be irreparably damaged which would not spell good things for humans and the other occupants of this
    planet. Pollution also contributes significantly to global warming.
